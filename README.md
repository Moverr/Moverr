### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<h1>Welcome to my Space </h1>
<p>
  My Name is <b>Muyinda Rogers</b>
I have worked in software engineering for over 6 years. During that time, I have had the opportunity to serve
as a member of software development teams in a range of companies, I have worked on high end Government
and NGO projects, through which I was able to develop strong communication skills as well as a good
appreciation for the collective strength of a workgroup. At the same time, I have handled a number of solo
coding projects, which has helped me develop a sense of meticulousness and attention to detail.

 -I am currently in pursuit of Bigdata, Micro Services and Machine Learning
